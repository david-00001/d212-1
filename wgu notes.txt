Here is a description of my dataset:

Scenario 1: Medical Readmission
In the medical industry, readmission of patients is such a problem that an external organization penalizes hospitals for excessive readmissions (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS). When it comes to readmission penalties, studies show that many hospitals are overconfident and underprepared. The percentage of hospitals penalized for readmissions has increased each year since CMS began imposing penalties, and according to the CMS reporting, as much as 78 percent of hospitals were fined in fiscal year 2015. However, three-quarters of hospitals feel confident in their ability to reduce readmissions, and only 55 percent of them anticipate receiving a penalty this year. Given the historical trend and the addition of COPD and Hip and Knee replacement to the list of medical conditions measured, the percentage of hospitals penalized will likely be much higher than 55 percent. Additionally, although hospitals are applying various reduction strategies, fewer than 1 in 5 utilize technology that is specific to reducing their readmissions, so they may not be doing all that they can.
You are an analyst on a team of analysts for a popular medical hospital chain with patients in almost every state in the United States. You have been asked to investigate the extent to which readmission is a problem for this chain of hospitals.
Note: The original reason for hospitalization is not provided in the data. The purpose of the analysis is to predict readmission based on other conditions and factors of the patient.

Data
Dictionary:
The data set includes the following information:
• patients who are readmitted to the hospital within a month of release (the “ReAdmis” column) • patient medical conditions (high blood pressure, stroke, obesity, arthritis, diabetes, etc.) • patient information (service they received while hospitalized, days in hospital, type of initial admission, etc.)  patient d emographic info rmation gender, age, job, education level, etc
The data set consists of 10,000 customers and 5 0 columns/ variables:
 CaseOrder: A placeholder variable to preserve the original order of the raw data file
 C ustomer _id Unique patient ID

Interaction UID Unique IDs related to patient transactions procedures and

I am doing a hierarchical clustering analysis and I've created my dendrogram. When looking at the dendrogram, what should I consider on where to cut the clusters?

also, my features are these: features = ['Population', 'Lat', 'Lng', 'Area_Rural', 'Area_Suburban', 'Area_Urban']

And I'm going to later calculate the average readmission per cluster
